<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:70px;">The Bests</h1>
<p> These are some of the best movie,shows,anime that I have ever watched.<br> The following list are not in ranking order.</p>


<h3 title="Clean the text"><b>1. The House That Jack Built</b></h3> 
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q3MDFiZGQtMjc4NS00MDJiLWFmYjgtNmI0MTQwMzUyOWNmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" alt="The house that jack Build Poster" width="180">
<a href="https://www.bilibili.tv/en/video/2043344774">Watch for free</a>
<p>The main theme of The House That Jack Built is the relationship between art, evil, and morality. The film treats Jack’s murders as a twisted form of artistic expression — he sees killing as “creating art,” which forces the audience to question whether art can justify cruelty or if beauty can exist in something immoral.</p>
<p>It also explores the nature of evil and guilt. Jack represents a person who intellectualizes his crimes, using logic and aesthetics to hide from his conscience. Throughout the film, he 
debates with a mysterious figure (Verge) about whether his actions have meaning, symbolizing humanity’s struggle between reason and morality.</p>

<h3><b>2.Takopi's Original Sin</b></h3>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/anitrendz.net/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Takopis-Original-Sin-main-visual-e1750743434431.jpeg" alt="Takopi's Original Sin main visual" width="400">
<p style="color:red;">The main theme of Takopi’s Original Sin is the contrast between innocence and human suffering</p>
<p1> — how good intentions, when paired with ignorance, can lead to tragedy. On the surface, Takopi is a pure, happy alien who only wants to spread joy. But when he meets Shizuka, a girl 
    burdened by abuse, bullying, and loneliness, his inability to understand real pain causes him to make things worse, not better. This reflects one of the story’s deepest ideas: true 
    happiness cannot exist without understanding sadness.</p1>

<pre> Some fo my Fav line/ Dialogues from this anime:
     “Letters are something you can hold on to. They make you feel like the person you love is still beside you.”
     “When someone says they love you, they aren’t commanding you. They’re wishing for your happiness.”
     “The stars are beautiful because they don’t know how lonely they are.”</pre>

<h3>The Boys </h3>
<img src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Boys-Season-4.jpg" alt="the boys poster" width=320>
<p>The boys is not your tipical superhero show. The superheros which are known to be kind, in this univers are notorious killer in disguise with super natural powers and on the other hand the protagonists are normal human-beings.<br> The show follows an <b>DARK</b> tone. It also shows the inhuman interation/incidence when there is huge gap in have and haves not.</p>
